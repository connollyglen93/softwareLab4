After entering username:admin@products.ie and password:password and clicking
the login button, \loginSubmit method is POSTed from routes, which checks
the form fields for input errors. If it doesn't find any errors it checks the role of the user and redirects to the
appropriate page, through either AdminController.products(Long cat) which will render the screen for adding or
removing products, or HomeController.index(), which renders the index page.
If there are input errors at the form the user is redirected back to the login page.

Editing/Adding a Product:
On the adminProducts.scala.html there are edit, delete and buttons.
If the edit button beside a product is clicked it runs the updateProduct method passing in the id of the product
next to it as the parameter for the method. The updateProduct method creates a form with the details
of the product and renders that form in the addProduct page allowing the user to edit the current information
about the product and save it back to the database. Clicking the Add a Product button passes a blank form to
the addProduct.scala.html page allowing the user to enter in details of the new product.

Deleting a Product:
If the admin hits the delete button next to a product the deleteProduct method is run which 
passes in the id of the product as an argument. This method finds the product byID and deletes it with the delete() method
from the database and renders the products page with a 'flash' method popping up a message stating that it was
successfully delete.
